# About Me

I studied computer science during my early years in undergrad. I realized how amazingly fun software development was; however, there was only so much a developer can do in creating awesome software for people. I then found UX Design at the intersection of software development and design, aimed to becoming the champion of the users. I instantly fell in love with everything the field stood for.

Understanding the users is the best way to create better experiences for them. Now I'm a Product Designer that thrives within highly functional and collaborative teams in that intersection between code-writing magicians and our users.

I aspire to design digital experiences that people don't frown nor raise their eyebrows at. Good UX is taken for granted, and bad UX is remembered. If users can't say much about the experiences I design, then I've done my job.

## My Story

### Background
I'm a UX/UI Designer with a passion for creating user-centered digital experiences. With a background in both design and development, I bring a unique perspective to every project.

### Specialization
I specialize in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and creating design systems that scale. My goal is to create intuitive, accessible, and beautiful interfaces that solve real user problems.

### Beyond Design
When I'm not designing, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the design community.
