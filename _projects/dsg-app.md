## Product Brief
The goal of this suite of mobile apps was to serve as the primary retail (iOS & Android) applications for the business. Our team was responsible for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of services for these applications.

## My Contributions
I played a pivotal part in redesigning our 4 mobile applications:
- Dick's Sporting Goods - iOS
- Dick's Sporting Goods - Android
- Golf Galaxy - iOS
- Golf Galaxy - Android

## Challenges
- Outdated back-end APIs & patterns
- Frankensteined app architecture
- Heavy dependency on existing web-services
- Uncharted territory of technology for business partners
- Managing multiple brands & platforms
- Limited resources & tight deadlines

## What do you mean "frankensteined"?
When I joined the Mobile App team, the then-current state of the mobile apps was a hodgepodge of native and web experiences. Poorly-managed hybrid experiences often led users to many UX pitfalls. There wasn't a single fully-native experience in the mobile apps and thus left users frustrated and reluctant to come back.

**The app was basically a mobile website wrapped in a native app package.**

Notice the amount of unnecessary information above where the fold of the mobile device would be. On a smaller device, users would not be able to see anything related to products above the fold.

## Process & Workflow

### Understanding the Business
How does our product contribute to the business? Who are all the stakeholders involved? Whose existing workflows do our products impact? Quickly gathering background information and data was key to asking the most impactful questions to the right groups of people.

### Understanding & Communicating Status
Understanding the current state of the product and the existing user base was the first plan of action.

### Strategic Business Alignment
We needed to tell our business partners what the current situation of the apps was, and a general north-star vision of where we wanted to be. With limited resources, we also needed a plan to address multiple apps simultaneously.
