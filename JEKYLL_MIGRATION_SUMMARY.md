# Jekyll Migration Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

Your portfolio website has been successfully converted from a static HTML site to a modern Jekyll-based static site generator! Here's what was completed:

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup
- **Installed Jekyll 4.4.1** with Ruby 3.2.2 via rbenv
- **Created Jekyll configuration** (`_config.yml`) with site settings
- **Set up Gemfile** with proper dependencies
- **Established directory structure** following Jekyll conventions

### 📄 Content Migration
- **Converted main pages** to Jekyll format:
  - `index.html` → `index.md` (homepage)
  - `about.html` → `_pages/about.md`
  - `portfolio.html` → `_pages/portfolio.md`
- **Created reusable layouts**:
  - `_layouts/default.html` (main layout)
  - `_layouts/project.html` (project-specific layout)
- **Built include components**:
  - `_includes/navigation.html`
  - `_includes/footer.html`

### 🎯 Project Pages
- **Migrated project pages** to Jekyll collections:
  - `main_project.html` → `_projects/dell-comparison.md`
  - `project_dsgapp.html` → `_projects/dsg-app.md`
  - `project_template.html` → `_projects/promo-engine.md`
  - `asb_project.html` → `_projects/detroit-services.md`

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

   - Test responsive design on different devices

2. **Customize project pages**:
   - Review the auto-generated project files in `_projects/`

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   # Visit http://localhost:4000
   ```

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Add a blog section** (if desired):
   ```bash
   mkdir _posts
   # Create blog posts with front matter
   ```

2. **Customize the theme**:

   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages** will automatically:
   - Build the Jekyll site
   - Deploy to `https://hyorkim11.github.io`
   - Update on every push to main branch
